# jCrystal's paradigm

jCrystal is a development framework and tool based in code generators, whose main objective is to boost the programmer (you!) by reducing coding time. 

Therefore, it works in a different way from traditional frameworks, it offers not only an abstraction to write backends, but also it constantly needs to generate code based on the custom code you wrote. So the development process in a  jCrystal backend is as follows:

1. Write logic and relevant code for your project.
2. Run jCrystal.
3. Code is automatically generated from the code written in 1, for you to use in your backend or client platforms.
4. Repeat 1 if necessary.

So remember, whenever you write some code run jCrystal and it will generate useful code for you. It might be strange the first few times, but soon you will find that jCrystal helps you create multiplatform applications easily. 

## Running jCrystal
Go to your Package Explorer, select your project and: 
- Pressing `CMD + 6`.

    or
- Pressing the jCrystal icon. ![jCrystal Logo](https://github.com/CrystalTechSAS/jcrystal_documentation/raw/master/images/logo_min.png "jCrystal Logo")
