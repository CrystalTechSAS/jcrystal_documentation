# Installation

## Requirements 

jCrystal requires **Java 1.8** or higher.

You can check whether you have Java 1.8 or higher, by entering the following command on a terminal:

```
java -version
```

You should see something like:
```
java version "1.8.0_144"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_144-b01)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.144-b01, mixed mode)
```

If you don't have Java installed this command will fail. If you have an older version of Java, the first line of the command will show a version number less than 1.8. 

You can obtain Java from [Oracleâ€™s JDK Site](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).
