# Installation

## Requirements 

jCrystal requires **Java 1.8** or higher.

You can check whether you have Java 1.8 or higher, by entering the following command on a terminal:

```
java -version
```

You should see something like:
```
java version "1.8.0_144"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_144-b01)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.144-b01, mixed mode)
```

If you don't have Java installed this command will fail. If you have an older version of Java, the first line of the command will show a version number less than 1.8. 

You can obtain Java from [Oracleâ€™s JDK Site](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html). 

## Setting up your IDE

Working with jCrystal it's easy. It integrates with your development environment, generating code that helps you create multiplataform applications **faster**.

### Eclipse

1. Install Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers, version 4.7 or later: [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/eclipse-packages/). 
2. Install [Google Cloud Plugin](https://cloud.google.com/eclipse/docs/quickstart).
3. Install Eclipse jCrystal Plugin: 
    1. Drag the install button into your running Eclipse workspace:

    <a href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/marketplace-client-intro?mpc_install=4943082" class="drag" title="Drag to your running Eclipse* workspace. *Requires Eclipse Marketplace Client"><img typeof="foaf:Image" class="img-responsive" src="https://marketplace.eclipse.org/sites/all/themes/solstice/public/images/marketplace/btn-install.png" alt="Drag to your running Eclipse* workspace. *Requires Eclipse Marketplace Client" /></a>
    
    Or inside Eclipse, select `Help > Eclipse Marketplace...` and search for **jCrystal Tools** and click **Install**. 

    2. On the new dialog, check de "jCrystal Tools" checkbox (if it's not checked already) and click **Confirm**.

    3. Choose "I accept the terms of the license agreement" and click **Finish**.

    4. Click **Install anyway** if a Security Warning dialog appears.

    5. Restart Eclipse when prompted.

You are ready to create applications using jCrystal! :tada:
