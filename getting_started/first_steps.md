# First steps

_jCrystal_ is a full-stack framework based on code generators. As such, different kinds of developers can use jCrystal. 

If you are a full-stack developer, read this:
1. Create your jCrystal project (backend)
2. Run and test your project (backend)
3. Do a hello world with a client:
    - Angular
    - Android
    - iOS

If you are a backend developer, read this:
1. Create your jCrystal project (backend)
2. Run and test your project (backend)
3. Working with a frontend team.

If you are a frontend developer, please take into account that you must work with someone who writes the backend in jCrystal and work a way to keep your generated code updated (we suggest this guide to work with a frontend team).
