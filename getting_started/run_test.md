# Running and testing your application

To test that everything is working as expected:
1. Create a new package named `controllers` on your Eclipse project.
2. Create a new java class inside the `controllers` package named `ManagerHello.java`.
3. Paste this inside that class:

```java
...
public class ManagerHello {
	public static String helloworld(){
		return "Hello World from jCrystal!";
	}
}
```
4. Run jCrystal by going to your Package Explorer, select your project and: 
    - Pressing `CTRL + 6` (Windows) or `CMD + 6` (Mac OS).

        or
    - Pressing the jCrystal icon. ![jCrystal Logo](https://github.com/CrystalTechSAS/jcrystal_documentation/raw/master/images/logo_min.png "jCrystal Logo")
    
5. Run your server by clicking on your project and selecting `Run As > App Engine`.
6. Go to _http://localhost:8080/api/hello/helloworld_ you should see this:
```json
{"success":1,"r":"Hello World from jCrystal!"}
```

Congratulations! You have created your first web service! Easy, right? :grin: So, what did just happened? Here's what's going on:

- On steps 2 to 3, you defined a web service on the route `api/hello/helloworld` that returns the string `Hello world from jCrystal`.
- On step 4, jCrystal scanned all your project files to know which code to generate to help you develop your app and then added the generated code to your project. 

    Check the folder `src/main/utils` of your project, you should see packages and classes that didn't exist before. All the files on this folder are generated by jCrystal and were created because jCrystal found something that could generate for you: everything needed to expose a web service that returns `Hello world from jCrystal` as was defined on steps 2 to 3.


- On steps 5 to 6 you ran your project locally and checked that the webservice was created.

You are ready to start building! Let's create something amazing!
