jCrystal is a framework to build **full-stack platforms** more **quickly** and with **less** code.

## What can you achieve with jCrystal?
jCrystal makes it easier to build **long-lasting backends**:

- **RESTful web services made easy**: One method is one web service, that's all. 
    
    No need to edit multiple files to create one web service, no need to worry about parsing params or the body in a request. 

- **Straightforward database storage and access**: write your data model, jCrystal does everything else. 

    No need to worry about tables, schemas or migrations. 

- **Painless user authentication and authorization**: authenticate your users, manage their sessions and authorize their actions without all the hassle. 

- **Admin site**: easily get an admin interface to manage the content of your backend.

- **Effortlessly** build your backend over a **highly-scalable NoSQL database and a highly-available infrastructure**.

    No configurations, by default that's your infrastructure. 

jCrystal helps you build **frontend apps on top of your backend** (or any backend):

- **Painless consumption of web services**: jCrystal generates the code to easily integrate with your web services. 

    No more long files with documentation of your web services, no need to worry about parsing params or the body of a request. 

- **Effortless access to your data model**: jCrystal generates your data model on your frontend language. 

    No need to repeat yourself and write the same data model on both backend and each frontend app. 

- **Simple access to the local database:** jCrystal saves stores and retrieves your information, no need to worry about your local database anymore. 

jCrystal does this and more because it's a framework based on **code generators**. In this way, jCrystal reduces code re-write web and mobile applications by reusing backend side data structures, business logic, and web services to generate frontend equivalents.
