# Uploading data on jCrystal web services

On jCrystal you can upload three types of data:

## Uploading entities

You can't upload an entity type directly as they are server side storage objects. But, you can upload types that can be converted to entities. Those types are called *Posts*.

Every entity have autogenerated post types that can be used to upload data and convert them to entities. Suppose you have the following entity Address:

```java
package company.example.data;

import jcrystal.reflection.annotations.\*;

@jEntity
public class Address {
	
	@EntityProperty(json = JsonLevel.BASIC)
	private static String name;

    @EntityProperty(json = JsonLevel.BASIC)
	private static String addressText;

    @EntityProperty
	private static String contactPhone;

    @EntityProperty(json = JsonLevel.DETAIL)
	private static String additionalInfo;

    @EntityProperty(json = JsonLevel.BASIC)
	private static GeoPt location;

}
```

You can post an create an Address using a WS like this:

```java
public static void anyName(Address.Post.Basic data){
    Address created = data.validate().create().put();
}
```

These will only post Basic or lower level data and create the address using only these data. In this case, only name, addressText and location will be uploaded.
